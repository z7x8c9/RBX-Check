# How it works?

At the beginning, the script reads your txt file. Then it sends a POST request to the roblox server with account data. And then sends a response to the log section. That's it!

# If programm dosen't work

- Check if accounts are stored in the correct format
  e.g. login:password
- Ð¡heck if you have a config.py file in the directory where your exe file is stored
